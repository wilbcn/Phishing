# ðŸ“§ Investigating Phishing Emails: 1

## ðŸ“– Overview
This document provides an overview of the steps taken to investigate a potential phishing email. In this scenario, I have received a real suspicious email, which inspired this project. I created this project to gain increased hands on experience and understanding of using a wide variety of tools for conducting phishing analysis, developing a better understanding of artifact collection, and phishing email diagnosis. Furthermore, to practice writing reports that a real security analyst might write up when investigating suspicious emails.

ðŸ’¡ This project was inspired by my learning in the** [**Blue Team Level 1**](https://www.securityblue.team/blue-team-level-1) course, where I gained a solid introduction into email analysis and artifact collection.

You can find the setup of the secure VM in AWS here -> [EC2 VM](https://github.com/wilbcn/DigitalForensics/blob/main/AWS-SecureVM/README.md)

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Successfully analyse the suspicious email in a secure environment
- Collect all relevant artifacts and organise them
- Use the collected artifact to carry out the investigation
- Leverage analysis tools for practice
- Document findings and create a final report

An initial analysis provides us with several red flags which indicate a potential phishing email.

- I am not addressed personally. If this were a legimate email, usually my first name would appear in the initial greeting.
- The apparent sender **mendesmend8pif@virgilio.it**. This is highly suspicious sender address.
- The overall body content is not that of a professional service, such as an estate agent advertising an apartment.
- No official company signature.

- Using URL2PNG tool, we can see that this domain takes us to an Italian news webpage, which has nothing to do with the body contents of the email, which is advertising apartments in Barcelona.
