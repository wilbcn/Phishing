# üìß Investigating Phishing Emails: 1

## üìñ Overview
This document provides an overview of the steps taken to investigate a potential phishing email. In this scenario, I have received a real suspicious email, which inspired this project. I created this project to gain increased hands on experience and understanding of using a wide variety of tools for conducting phishing analysis, developing a better understanding of artifact collection, and phishing email diagnosis. Furthermore, to practice writing reports that a real security analyst might write up when investigating suspicious emails.

üí° This project was inspired by my learning in the** [**Blue Team Level 1**](https://www.securityblue.team/blue-team-level-1) course, where I gained a solid introduction into email analysis and artifact collection.

You can find the setup of the secure VM in AWS here -> [EC2 VM](https://github.com/wilbcn/DigitalForensics/blob/main/AWS-SecureVM/README.md)

## üéØ Goals
- Successfully analyse the suspicious email in a secure environment
- Collect all relevant artifacts and organise them
- Use the collected artifact to carry out the investigation
- Leverage analysis tools for practice
- Document findings and create a final report

## Tools used
- Email header analyzer: https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx

## 1. Email overview.
I moved the suspicious email onto my EC2 VM, and opened it using Mozilla Thunderbird. For security/privacy reasons, my email address has been hidden.

An initial analysis provides us with several red flags which indicate a potential phishing email.

- Lack of personalised greeting. A legitimate email would address me formally.
- The apparent sender **mendesmend8pif@virgilio.it**. This is highly suspicious sender address.
- The overall body content is not that of a professional service, such as an estate agent advertising an apartment.
- No official company signature.
- The email itself is unsolicited.
- The email asks for me to engage with it in order to find out more information. 

## 2. Collecting Artifacts.
To gather the email artifacts to investigate further into this email, I used the email header analyzer tool from mxtoolbox. I opened the .eml in notepad++, and copied the header into the tool.

‚úÖ DMARC Compliant ‚Äì The email passed DMARC authentication, meaning the sender‚Äôs domain has a DMARC policy in place.
‚úÖ SPF Alignment & SPF Authenticated ‚Äì The email originated from an authorized mail server, as specified in the domain‚Äôs SPF records.
‚úÖ DKIM Alignment ‚Äì The DKIM signature matches the expected sending domain, which typically confirms the email was not altered in transit.
‚ùå DKIM Authentication failed suggesting that:

- The DKIM signature may have been forged.
- The signature didn‚Äôt match the cryptographic key in DNS.
- The email could have been modified after signing, indicating a possible spoofing attempt.

The tool also provides us with a wide variety of valuable artifacts, under the headers section. 

| **Header Field**       | **Value** |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Delivered-To**       | *(Hidden Address)* |
| **Return-Path**        | `<mendesmend8pif@virgilio.it>` |
| **Date**              | Thu, 20 Feb 2025 21:39:09 +0100 (CET) |
| **From**              | `mendesmend8pif@virgilio.it` |
| **Subject**           | Lloguer en Carrer Gran de Gr√†cia - Metro Lesseps Barcelona BBZM18 |
| **Received-SPF**      | `pass (google.com: domain of mendesmend8pif@virgilio.it designates 213.209.9.36 as permitted sender)` |
| **Client IP**         | `213.209.9.36` |
| **X-Originating-IP**  | `2.39.110.75` |
